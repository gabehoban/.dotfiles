It applies to the current web site only, it is not a global power button.\n\n***\n\nFlexible, it's more than an \"ad blocker\": it can also read and create filters from hosts files.\n\nOut of the box, these lists of filters are loaded and enforced:\n\n- EasyList\n- Peter Lowe’s Ad server list\n- EasyPrivacy\n- Malware domains\n\nMore lists are available for you to select if you wish:\n\n- Fanboy’s Enhanced Tracking List\n- Dan Pollock’s hosts file\n- hpHosts’s Ad and tracking servers\n- MVPS HOSTS\n- Spam404\n- And many others\n\nOf course, the more filters enabled, the higher the memory footprint. Yet, even after adding Fanboy's two extra lists, hpHosts’s Ad and tracking servers, uBlock Origin still has a lower memory footprint than other very popular blockers out there.\n\nAlso, be aware that selecting some of these extra lists may lead to higher likelihood of web site breakage -- especially those lists which are normally used as hosts file.\n\n***\n\nFree.\nOpen source with public license (GPLv3)\nFor users by users.\n\nIf ever you really do want to contribute something, think about the people working hard to maintain the filter lists you are using, which were made available to use by all for free.\n\n***\n\nDocumentation:\nhttps://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin\n\nProject change log:\nhttps://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/releases\n\nContributors @ Github:\nhttps://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/graphs/contributors\n\nContributors @ Crowdin:\nhttps://crowdin.net/project/ublock","weeklyDownloads":287050,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Raymond Hill","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/11423598/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/230/230365.png?modified=1578152397","width":800,"height":600,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/230/230365.png?modified=1578152397","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":480,"caption":"Default mode"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/230/230368.png?modified=1578152397","width":800,"height":600,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/230/230368.png?modified=1578152397","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":480,"caption":"The dashboard: stock filter lists"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/230/230367.png?modified=1578152397","width":800,"height":600,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/230/230367.png?modified=1578152397","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":480,"caption":"Dynamic filtering allows default-deny modes"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/230/230369.png?modified=1578152397","width":800,"height":600,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/230/230369.png?modified=1578152397","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":480,"caption":"The dashboard: settings"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/230/230370.png?modified=1578152402","width":800,"height":600,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/230/230370.png?modified=1578152402","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":480,"caption":"The unified logger tells you all that uBO is seeing and doing"}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.7111,"reviewCount":3876,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/reviews/","updateDate":1579964410000},{"id":"jid1-BoFifL9Vbdl2zQ@jetpack","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/521/521554-32.png?modified=mcrushed","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/521/521554-64.png?modified=mcrushed","128":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/521/521554-128.png?modified=mcrushed"},"name":"Decentraleyes","version":"2.0.13","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3423038/decentraleyes-2.0.13-an+fx.xpi?src=","homepageURL":"https://decentraleyes.org","supportURL":"https://decentraleyes.org","description":"Protects you against tracking through \"free\", centralized, content delivery.

Canceling requests for ads or trackers is usually without issue, however blocking actual content, not unexpectedly, breaks pages. The aim of this add-on is to cut out the middleman by providing lightning speed delivery of local (bundled) files to improve online privacy.\n\n     • Protects privacy by evading large delivery networks that claim to offer free services.\n     • Complements regular blockers such as uBlock Origin (recommended), Adblock Plus, et al.\n     • Works directly out of the box; absolutely no prior configuration required.\n\nNote: Decentraleyes is no silver bullet, but it does prevent a lot of websites from making you send these kinds of requests.

HTTP enables visitors to view a website and send information back and forth to the server. HTTPS, or Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol Secure, is communication through a secure connection. Communications through HTTPS are encrypted by a secure certificate known as an SSL. The encryption prevents third-parties from eavesdropping on communications to and from the server. Read more about HTTPS here.\n\nKey features:\n\na. Automatically change all HTTP requests to the secure HTTPS\nb. All websites (addresses) that do not support HTTPS are remembered in order to speed up the protocol-check process. Note that you can see and delete these items from the extension's Options page.\nc.

All that tracking code is not necessary for a website to be displayed or work correctly and can therefore be removed—that is exactly what ClearURLs does.\n\nAnother common example are Amazon URLs. If you search for a product on Amazon you will see a very long URL, such as: https://www.amazon.com/dp/exampleProduct/ref=sxin_0_pb?__mk_de_DE=ÅMÅŽÕÑ&keywords=tea&pd_rd_i=exampleProduct&pd_rd_r=8d39e4cd-1e4f-43db-b6e7-72e969a84aa5&pd_rd_w=1pcKM&pd_rd_wg=hYrNl&pf_rd_p=50bbfd25-5ef7-41a2-68d6-74d854b30e30&pf_rd_r=0GMWD0YYKA7XFGX55ADP&qid=1517757263&rnid=2914120011\n\nIndeed most of the above URL is tracking code. Once ClearURLs has cleaned the address, it will look like this:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/exampleProduct\n\nWhy use this extension as opposed to similar ones?\nMost other “link cleaners” employ about a dozen rules when looking for tracking parameters to remove. ClearURLs utilizes over 130 rules, so its capabilities are more comprehensive.\nAnd ClearURLs is open source, so everyone can join in to the project and/or can check the source code to error or malicious code.\n\nWhat do we collect?\nThis extension protects and respects your privacy.
